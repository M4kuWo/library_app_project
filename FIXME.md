- [x] Loan routes receive a 404 response _02/10/2024_
    - the issue was the routes had /loans twice (once in the app.py file set as api/loans and twice in the loans_routes.py file set as /loans) and I was calling it once in the URL
- [ ] Bcrypt causing silent error when performing the login route. The route is successfull though and the token provided is valid but there is an error in the background for some reason. Probably version discrepancies in dependencies.
- [ ] Not exactly a bug but the admin validation is currently being done by getting the email from the token and searching for the user in the database to check his profile. This would probably be better if everything came directly from the token since it has all necessary info
- [ ] Storing tokens in cookies with the set_cookie statement doesn't work. Set it to store on local storage but storing in cookies might be a better approach
